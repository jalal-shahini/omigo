# Jalal's Hugo Theme

This is a basic Hugo theme I use for [my personal website](https://jalalshahini.com) and my blog, [Avennathan](https://avennathan.com).
It draws some design cues from the [hermit theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hermit-v2/) and uses some of the graphics.
The colors are from the gruvbox theme.
