# Jalal's Hugo Theme

This is a basic Hugo theme I use for [my personal website](https://jalalshahini.com) and my blog, [Avennathan.com](https://avennathan.com).
It draws some design cues from the [hermit](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hermit-v2/) theme and uses some of its graphics.
The colors are from [gruvbox](https://github.com/gruvbox-community/gruvbox).
